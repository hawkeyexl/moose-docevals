/**
 * A judge cache that refuses to persist an ensemble containing an errored run.
 *
 * The library's `runEnsemble` caches unconditionally — it has no way to know
 * whether an error is a property of the request or of the moment. Here we do:
 * an error is an infrastructure failure (VRAM exhausted, rate limited,
 * connection dropped), never a verdict about the page. Writing one to the cache
 * turns a transient outage into a permanent answer, and `--no-cache` becomes
 * the only way out of a state nothing explains.
 *
 * That is worst for a committed cache, whose whole purpose is to let CI replay
 * real verdicts with no provider reachable. Caching an error there commits the
 * outage: every future run replays it, the evals sit in human-review forever,
 * and the fixtures look valid the entire time. This was not hypothetical — a
 * local run at concurrency 4 exhausted VRAM and wrote 65 errored ensembles into
 * `docs/.moose-docevals-cache/` (ADR 01038).
 *
 * Subclassed rather than wrapped because `JsonCache` has private fields, so a
 * structurally-identical object does not satisfy its type.
