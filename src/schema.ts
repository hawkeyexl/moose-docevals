/**
 * The published frontmatter schema — moose-docevals' implementation of the
 * common vocabulary docmeta proposes as `docmeta:evals:1.0.0-proposal.2`
 * (docmeta proposal 0023). docmeta publishes the vocabulary; this repo ships a
 * schema for it and implements the graders behind it. Consumers point their
 * validator at the shipped file (or import the object directly).
 *
 *   docmeta validate --schema node_modules/moose-docevals/schemas/frontmatter-1.1.0.json docs/
 *
 * In a moose-docevals config, a `tool:docmeta` eval references it the same way:
 *
 *   options:
 *     schemas: ["node_modules/moose-docevals/schemas/frontmatter-1.1.0.json"]
 *
 * **1.0.0 still ships and is still byte-identical.** Its bytes are frozen once
 * published, so tracking proposal.2 — which added `weight`, `target`, `runs`
 * and `model` — meant a new file rather than an edit. Every 1.0.0 page is valid
 * against 1.1.0; the four fields are optional additions. A consumer that pinned
 * 1.0.0 by path or by `$id` keeps resolving it, which is the whole point of not
 * editing it.
