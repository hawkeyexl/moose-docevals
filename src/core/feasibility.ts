/**
 * Pre-run feasibility: evals that cannot reach a verdict as configured.
 *
 * ADRs 01020 and 01022 already make an eval that reached no verdict a failure
 * rather than a pass — but they do it at grade time, which for an `ai` eval is
 * after the judge has been paid. Everything here is knowable from the resolved
 * config and page alone, so it is knowable before a single call goes out.
 *
 * `claude plugin eval` computes the same class of thing and prints it up
 * front, on the reasoning that an infeasible check scores zero in every arm
 * and reads as "the tool found nothing" rather than as "you configured this
 * wrong". That is exactly the confusion worth spending a cheap static pass to
 * avoid.
 *
 * Scope is deliberately narrow: only what *configuration* makes impossible,
 * and only where nothing already answers it. Whether `vale` is on PATH is a
 * runtime fact ADR 01020 covers; an unknown grader kind is already an errored
 * result in the engine; and an `ai` eval with no assertion is already rejected
 * by both schemas at parse time, with a better message than this could give.
 * A second answer to a settled question is worse than none.
