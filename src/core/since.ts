 * git. `rev-parse --show-toplevel` doubles as the is-this-a-repo check and
 * supplies the anchor the diff's paths are relative to.
 *
 * The anchor is the whole point. `git diff --name-only` prints paths relative
 * to the repository top level, while `PageFile.file` is relative to the
 * *discovery* root — the two differ whenever the config lives in a
 * subdirectory. Comparing them directly does not throw; it simply matches

 * evaluated nothing. Reconciling in absolute space is what makes that
