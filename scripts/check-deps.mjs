/**
 * Assert that this checkout's dependencies are installed *in this checkout*,
 * at the versions package-lock.json pins.
 *
 * Why this exists: the repo keeps git worktrees at `.claude/worktrees/<name>/`,
 * nested inside the main checkout. A worktree whose dependencies were never
 * installed does not fail loudly — Node's resolution walks up the directory
 * chain and silently finds the outer checkout's `node_modules`, which belongs
 * to whatever branch is checked out there. `tsc` and `vitest` then run against
 * another branch's dependency tree, and the resulting type errors and test
 * failures read as real code bugs.
 *
 * Only direct dependencies are checked. They are the ones npm always places at
 * `<root>/node_modules/<name>`, so a miss is unambiguous — no guessing about
 * hoisting, and no false alarm from an optional transitive package npm
 * legitimately skipped on this platform.
 *
 * It also asserts that the npm running it is new enough to write a complete
 * lockfile — see MIN_NPM below. Both are questions about the environment rather
 * than the code, and both produce failures that read as code bugs when left
 * unnamed, which is why they share a guard.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/check-deps.mjs [path/to/root]
 * Exit 0 = dependencies are sound, 1 = problems found, 2 = setup error.

/**
 * The oldest npm that writes a complete `package-lock.json` for this tree.
 *
 * At 11.6.2 and below, npm drops the top-level entries for the peer
 * dependencies of an optional package — here `@emnapi/core` and
 * `@emnapi/runtime`, reached through `@rolldown/binding-wasm32-wasi`
 * (vitest → vite → rolldown) — while keeping the dependency edges that point at
 * them. The lockfile still installs, so nothing looks wrong locally; `npm ci`
 * rejects it, so on the next push every CI job fails at once with
 * `Missing: @emnapi/core@<ver> from lock file`. Nothing in that message names
 * npm's version, so it is very hard to reach from the symptom.
 *
 * This repo reached the wrong one. CLAUDE.md carried a "never use npm ci" rule
 * for months, on the theory that the lockfile was mis-authored *on Windows*. It
 * was not: 11.6.2 drops those entries on Linux, macOS and Windows alike, and
 * 11.6.3 keeps them on all three. The floor is what makes `npm ci` usable again.
 *
 * The floor is exact rather than rounded up to the next minor: 11.6.3 and
 * 11.6.4 both write a complete lockfile, and rejecting them would block a
 * contributor whose npm is fine.
