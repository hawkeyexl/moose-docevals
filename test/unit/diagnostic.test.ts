/**
 * "A grader that reached no verdict fails the eval, at any severity"
 * (ADR 01022), tested where the rule lives.
 *
 * The decision moved this property out of the adapters and into one line of
 * `core/engine.ts`:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const hasError = own.some((f) => f.severity === "error" || f.diagnostic === true);
 * ```
 *
 * Nothing tested that line. The adapter tests assert that a diagnostic finding
 * carries the flag, which is only half of it — the half that fails the eval is
 * the engine's, and an adapter test cannot see it. So drive a real
 * `severity: warning` eval through `runEvals` with a fake exec and assert the
 * outcome, both ways round: the diagnostic fails it, and an ordinary warning
 * finding on the same eval still passes. The second case is what proves the
 * failure came from the flag rather than from severity handling.
