/**
 * `--eval` / `--suite` selection (ADR 01018).
 *
 * The flags are easy; what they do to the exit code is not. `summarizeSuites`
 * computes a pass rate over the results *present in the run*, and `hasFailure`
 * fails a run whose suite misses its target — so a run filtered to one passing
 * eval out of twelve would compute 1/1, meet a target of 1.0, and exit 0 on
 * evidence it never gathered. These tests exist mostly to pin that it cannot.
