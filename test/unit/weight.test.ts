/**
 * Per-eval `weight` and its effect on a suite's pass rate.
 *
 * Weight changes how much an outcome moves the suite total; it never changes
 * the outcome itself. That split is the whole design: the binary per-eval
 * verdict is what SARIF, JUnit and the findings baseline consume, and a
 * weighted *score* leaking into it would change all three. So every test here
 * asserts the outcomes are untouched alongside the rate that moved.
 *
 * The denominator is the graded set — pass + fail + error — exactly as it was
 * before weights existed. `needs-review` and `skipped` stay out of both halves.
 *
 * Two freshness evals against fixed dates, so nothing needs a provider or a
 * subprocess.
