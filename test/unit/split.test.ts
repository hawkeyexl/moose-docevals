/**
 * Splitting long content instead of truncating it.
 *
 * The defect this replaces was silent: `fill` and `scriptgen` sliced at 6000
 * characters and appended a marker nothing downstream read, so a long page was
 * filled and script-generated from its first half with no signal that the rest
 * was never seen.
 *
 * For the judge the question is different — merging per-part *verdicts* is
 * unsound, because "documents X" needs OR across parts and "never promises X"
 * needs AND, and an assertion's text does not say which. So parts contribute
 * evidence and one judge answers once. These tests pin that a page which fits
 * is untouched, and that one which does not is read in parts.
