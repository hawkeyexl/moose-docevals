/**
 * The missing-provider warning on `run`, one row per meaningful flag
 * combination (ADR 01032).
 *
 * The condition was `if (!options.deterministicOnly || options.generate === true)`.
 * Commander defaults a `--no-generate` flag's key to `true`, so the second
 * clause held unless `--no-generate` was passed — and the warning was
 * therefore suppressed only by the accidental pairing
 * `--deterministic-only --no-generate`. `--deterministic-only` on its own, the
 * standard no-API-key CI invocation, warned about the AI provider it had just
 * been told to skip.
 *
 * The intent was "generation was explicitly requested", which commander cannot
 * express: there is no `--generate` flag, so `generate` is `true` by default
 * and `false` only when negated. The warning is therefore about the judge, and
 * the judge alone — generation's own missing-provider signal is an `error`
 * result the engine raises where it is actually knowable.
