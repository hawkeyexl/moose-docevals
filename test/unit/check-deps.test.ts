/**
 * Guard for `scripts/check-deps.mjs`.
 *
 * The bug it exists for: this repo keeps git worktrees at
 * `.claude/worktrees/<name>/`, *inside* the main checkout. A worktree whose
 * dependencies were never installed does not fail — Node's resolution walks up
 * and silently finds the outer checkout's `node_modules`, which belongs to
 * whatever branch happens to be checked out there. Typecheck and tests then run
 * against another branch's dependency tree and report failures that read as
 * real code bugs.
 *
 * Driven as a subprocess rather than an import: the exit code and the stderr
 * text are the contract, since this runs as a `pre*` hook.

 * failing at once with `Missing: @emnapi/core@<ver> from lock file`. Nothing

 * This repo diagnosed that symptom as a Windows lockfile-authoring quirk and
