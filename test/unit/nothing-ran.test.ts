/**
 * A run that checked nothing must not read as success (ADR 01030).
 *
 * The shape this file exists for: a corpus whose pages carry no eval
 * frontmatter, against a config whose `defaults.suite` is `null`. Every page
 * discovers, every page resolves, and not one eval attaches — so `runEvals`
 * returned `evalResults: []`, `hasFailure` had no "nothing ran" term, and the
 * run exited **0** after printing a blank line and the word `Suites`. The same
 * condition reached through `--eval no-such-eval` was already exit 2 with a
 * careful message (ADR 01018); reached through configuration it was silence.
 *
 * The boundary these tests pin is *where* the check sits. It reads the
 * **resolved** plan, before any narrowing:
 *
 * - `--eval` / `--suite` own their own empty-match error (ADR 01018), and it
 *   names what was asked for.
 * - `--since` deliberately answers "no page changed" with exit 0 and a
 *   sentence (ADR 01029), so it must not be converted into a usage error by a
 *   check that runs after scoping.
 * - A resolution error is itself the diagnosis, and must not be swallowed by
 *   an empty-plan error raised in front of it.
