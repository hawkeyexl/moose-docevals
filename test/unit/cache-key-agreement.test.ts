/**
 * The judge's cache key and the key an outside caller computes must be the
 * same key.
 *
 * `scripts/check-docs-cache.mjs` answers "is this verdict already cached?"
 * without running the judge, and it used to answer it by reproducing the key
 * composition by hand. That went silently wrong the moment the judge started
 * prefixing the chunk budget: every key the script computed matched nothing,
 * which reads as "the entire committed cache is missing" and, under `--prune`,
 * as "every file is an orphan". Nothing failed — the numbers were just wrong.
 *
 * The script now builds keys from the judge's own exports. This pins that they
 * agree, by the only means that cannot drift: write a cache entry under the
 * externally-computed key, then run the judge against a provider that throws if
 * it is called. A hit proves the two compositions are identical; a miss reaches
 * the provider and fails loudly.
