/**

 * `makeGenerateScripts` itself is covered by scriptgen.test.ts, but nothing
 * exercised the loop that feeds it, and the fixture dogfood in CI runs with
 * `--no-generate`, so the branch was dark end to end as well.
 *
 * Every assertion here is about what does or does not become a target. The
 * MockProvider is scripted with one usable response and its `requests` array is
