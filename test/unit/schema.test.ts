/**
 * The frontmatter schema is published from this repo (shipped in the package
 * under schemas/), not registered as a built-in inside a validator. These
 * tests pin the published artifact: it must be resolvable by path, usable by
 * docmeta as a plain schema file, and it must accept the fixture corpus.
 *
 * They also pin the *vocabulary* — moose-docevals implements
 * `docmeta:evals:1.0.0-proposal.1` (docmeta proposal 0023), so the ladder below
 * is ported from that proposal's own `ladders/evals-examples.cjs`. The
 * negatives are the migration guard: every 0.1 spelling has to fail loudly,
 * because a page that silently resolves to defaults is the failure mode this
 * whole rename exists to avoid.
