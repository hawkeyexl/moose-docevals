/**
 * Pre-run feasibility.
 *
 * ADRs 01020/01022 already refuse to call a missing verdict a pass — but they
 * decide that at grade time, which for an `ai` eval is after the judge has been
 * paid. Everything checked here is knowable from the config and the page, so it
 * is knowable for free.
 *
 * The headline case is a misspelled grader option. `options` is open in the
 * published vocabulary by design, so before this `max-age-day: 30` fell
 * straight through to the default of 365 and the eval quietly checked
 * something its author never wrote.
