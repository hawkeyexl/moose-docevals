# Audience: Brownfield corpus *(cross-cutting lens)*

**Scope:** a lens, not a segment. It is defined by the **state of the corpus** — thousands of pages
accumulated over years, written by people who have left, with no evals on any of them — rather than by
who owns the docs. It cuts across [`aud-docs-platform-team`](docs-platform-team.md),
[`aud-solo-docs-owner`](solo-docs-owner.md), and
[`aud-quality-standard-owner`](quality-standard-owner.md), and it is listed separately because the
adoption problem it creates is genuinely different from theirs.

## Why this is its own lens

Every other audience file describes a **steady state**: evals exist, the gate runs, someone maintains
it. This lens describes the **transition into** that state, which fails for its own reasons.

The failure is arithmetic. Turn an honest quality bar on a corpus that has never been measured and
essentially everything fails at once. That result is simultaneously accurate and useless: it cannot be
triaged, it cannot be merged, and it teaches the team that the tool is wrong rather than that the docs
are. Adoption dies at the first run. Every product decision aimed at this lens — `fill`'s confidence
threshold, `severity: warning`, capability suites with a target pass rate below 1.0, page-level `skip`
— exists to make that first run survivable.

The overlap is real and should not be papered over: a docs platform team retrofitting 3,000 pages is
in both this lens and its home segment, and needs both sets of pages. The lens exists so the
transition gets designed for explicitly instead of being assumed away.

## Who they are

Whoever is handed the retrofit: a staff writer on a quarter-long initiative, a contractor, a new docs
hire told to "get quality under control," or the solo owner on a weekend. Frequently *not* the person
who wrote the content, and often without authority to delete any of it.

## What they're trying to do

Get a corpus that has never been measured under continuous evaluation, on a ratchet — where each step
is small, mergeable, and leaves the build green — without a day-one wall of red and without hand-
authoring thousands of assertions.

## Defining pains

- **The wall of red.** The single defining pain. The first honest run is unmergeable, and the instinct
  it produces — weaken the assertions until the build is green — permanently destroys the standard.
  The correct move is the opposite: keep the assertions honest, start at `severity: warning`, and
  ratchet severity up as pages are fixed. That inversion is unintuitive and must be taught directly.
- **Hand-authoring does not scale to the corpus size.** `fill` is the only viable entry point, which
  means its confidence gate, its caching, and its turn budget are adoption-critical here in a way they
  are not for a greenfield corpus.
- **Machine-proposed evals need triage, and that is a new job.** A proposal above the threshold is not
  automatically a good assertion. Reviewing a few hundred proposed evals is real work that has to be
  planned for, and the docs should say so rather than implying `fill` finishes the job.
- **Cost is front-loaded and lumpy.** The initial pass over the whole corpus is by far the largest
  spend the team will ever see, and it arrives before any value has been demonstrated. Batching by
  directory, capping each batch with `--max-turns`, and knowing that the raw proposal cache makes both
  re-gating and the subsequent write pass free are what keep it defensible.
- **Not every page is worth evaluating.** Deprecated sections, generated reference, and archives
  should be excluded rather than fixed. `files.exclude` and page-level `skip` are triage tools, and
  triage has to be presented as a legitimate first step, not as giving up.

## Buying constraints

- Must be adoptable **incrementally by directory**. Nobody can review a 3,000-page pull request.
- Must produce a demonstrable win early — one section under a real gate beats partial coverage
  everywhere — because the initiative needs a result before its budget is questioned.
- The size of the initial pass must be estimable in advance — and it is, arithmetically: `fill` spends
  one inference call per uncached page, so the page count *is* the estimate and `--max-turns` caps it
  before the first call. That arithmetic needs to be the first thing this lens is shown.

## Qualified reader (for docs targeting)

- **Prerequisites they bring:** whatever their home segment brings — this lens does not change
  technical proficiency, only the situation.
- **Prerequisites they do not bring:** familiarity with the corpus itself. They often did not write
  it, cannot vouch for it, and may not know which sections are still true.
- **Subject dependencies:** the eval model and `fill` must both be understood before the retrofit
  path makes sense, which is why `adopt/retrofit-a-legacy-corpus.mdx` sits after `adopt/index.mdx`
  rather than opening the section.
