proficiency:
  [github-actions, gitlab-ci, jenkins, pre-commit, shell, json-tooling, secret-management,

prerequisites: [exit-code-conventions, ci-artifact-and-cache-model, fork-pr-security-model]
goals:
  - One parameterized recipe that behaves identically in every repo
  - A ceiling on inference calls the job cannot exceed
  - Machine-readable output that flows into existing dashboards without custom parsing
  - Certainty that a fork pull request cannot execute its author's code on a runner
pains:
  - A model in the critical path is slow, rate-limitable, nondeterministic, and metered
  - Content files drive code execution by two different paths, and one flag only covers one of them
  - Exit 1 and exit 2 route to different humans and must never be conflated
  - Secrets are unavailable on forks by design, so the fork path must work without a provider

# Persona: Devin

**Scope:** the operator persona for [`aud-platform-ci`](../audiences/platform-ci.md). Devin installs
and runs the gate and authors no evals at all. Authoring belongs to
[Priya](priya-corpus-owner.md) and [Sara](sara-standard-owner.md).

**Deliberately the same Devin as docmeta's.** He is one engineer wiring one pipeline, and he does not
experience the two tools as separate adoptions — see
[`_overview.md`](_overview.md) for why the names are shared.

Devin maintains CI for dozens of repos on a mix of GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, and pre-commit.
He scripts everything, distrusts per-repo snowflakes, and knows from experience that any check which
is slow, flaky, or expensive gets disabled by the first team it inconveniences. He arrives because a
docs team asked for a step, or because a docs check started costing money and it landed on his desk.

He inherits two problems from moose-docevals that docmeta never gave him, and they are what make him a
first-class persona here rather than a footnote.

**A model is in the critical path.** Slow, rate-limitable, nondeterministic, and metered per call —
four novel failure modes for a CI step. He needs the ensemble, the response cache, `--max-turns`, and
`--deterministic-only` presented as *operational controls* he reaches for, not as quality features he
reads past. The cache in particular has to survive between runs or the economics collapse, so where
it lives and what belongs in a CI cache key is load-bearing reference material for him. He also needs
telling that `--max-turns` bounds *work*, not money: the tool counts inference calls and reports no
dollar figure, and a run that exhausts its budget skips the rest and still exits `0`. Devin is the
persona most likely to set that number once and never look at it again, which is exactly who a
silently degraded green run hurts.

**Content files drive arbitrary code execution, by two paths.** Page frontmatter can declare commands,
gated by `scripts.allow-frontmatter-commands` and `--no-frontmatter-commands`. Separately, the
`tool:doc-detective` grader executes steps embedded in page *bodies* — and the flag does **not** gate
that. On a fork pull request an attacker controls both. Devin is the only persona equipped to reason
about this, and the honest answer he needs is that the flag is not sufficient: the job itself must be
gated to same-repo pull requests. Any page that implies otherwise is actively dangerous, which makes
[`ci/untrusted-pull-requests.mdx`](../information-architecture/proposed-ia.md) the highest-stakes page
on the site even though it is not the highest-traffic one.

He will notice an unpinned third-party action in a recipe, and he will not trust a page that has one.

Success for Devin is a recipe he pastes into four repos unchanged, that has never woken him up, whose
usage he can point at on a graph, and that he does not think about again.
