# Personas

**Scope:** one minimal persona per audience, and the map between them. The segments themselves are in
[`../audiences/`](../audiences/_overview.md); the journeys these people take are in
[`../journeys/`](../journeys/_overview.md).

## The map

| Persona | Audience | Role | In one line |
|---|---|---|---|
| [**Priya**](priya-corpus-owner.md) `persona-corpus-owner` *(lead)* | [`aud-docs-platform-team`](../audiences/docs-platform-team.md) | Documentation platform lead | Wants the quality bar enforced by the pipeline instead of by her own review fatigue. |
| [**Nate**](nate-solo-owner.md) `persona-solo-owner` | [`aud-solo-docs-owner`](../audiences/solo-docs-owner.md) | Engineer who owns the docs | Wants meaningful coverage of 200 pages in an afternoon, for a few dollars. |
| [**Devin**](devin-pipeline-owner.md) `persona-pipeline-owner` | [`aud-platform-ci`](../audiences/platform-ci.md) | Platform / CI engineer | Wants one gate that behaves identically everywhere, cannot overspend, and cannot run a stranger's code. |
| [**Sara**](sara-standard-owner.md) `persona-standard-owner` | [`aud-quality-standard-owner`](../audiences/quality-standard-owner.md) | Docs quality standard owner | Wants to prove the judge agrees with her often enough to gate a build on. |
| [**Theo**](theo-contributor.md) `persona-contributor` | [`aud-doc-contributor`](../audiences/doc-contributor.md) | Occasional doc contributor | Wants the one red check on his PR to go green. |
| [**Iris**](iris-retrofitter.md) `persona-retrofitter` | [`aud-brownfield-corpus`](../audiences/brownfield-corpus.md) *(cross-cutting)* | Corpus retrofitter | Wants 3,000 unmeasured pages onto a ratchet without a day-one wall of red. |

## Why three names are borrowed from docmeta

**Devin, Sara, and Theo are deliberately the same people as docmeta's personas of those names.** The
two tools are adopted by one reader in one pipeline. The engineer who wires up a metadata gate is the
engineer who wires up an eval gate. The contributor who hits a red frontmatter check is the
contributor who hits a red eval. Reusing the names keeps that continuity legible to anyone working
across both repos, and keeps the two strategies comparable rather than parallel-but-unrelated.

The roles are not identical, and the differences are the interesting part. moose-docevals' Devin inherits
two problems docmeta's Devin never had, namely a model in the critical path and content-driven code
execution. moose-docevals' Sara owns prose assertions rather than JSON Schema. Priya, Nate, and Iris
are new here. docmeta's lead persona splits into Priya and Nate along the hours-available axis.
`fill` makes the one-person case a genuinely different journey rather than a smaller one.

## The model is a qualified reader, not a skill tier

No persona is labeled beginner, intermediate, or advanced. Those labels describe a person and travel
badly. What a writer actually needs to know is **what this reader already brings** and **what they
must have read first**. Each persona file therefore carries:

- **Prerequisites they bring**, meaning knowledge assumed on arrival, which the page must not re-teach.
- **Prerequisites they do not bring**, the trap. Assuming any of these produces a page that reads
  fine to its author and is unusable by its reader.
- **Subject dependencies**, the pages that must come first for this one to land. These fix the
  reading order inside each section of the IA.

The strictest case is Theo, who has *no* subject dependencies by construction: `fix/index.mdx` may not
assume any other page has been read. Any change that gives it a dependency is a defect.
