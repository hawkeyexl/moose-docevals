# CUJ: Resolve an eval that landed in human review

**Scope:** the recurring operational loop of clearing the review queue. Establishing confidence in the
judge as a whole is [`cuj-trust-the-judge`](cuj-trust-the-judge.md) — a periodic, project-shaped
activity. This one is a Tuesday.

**Trigger.** A pull request is blocked, or a report shows evals in the needs-review zone, and a human
has to decide.

**Narrative.** This is a small journey with an outsized effect on whether the tool survives, because
it is where the **human-review zone stops being an elegant design idea and becomes someone's inbox.**
A queue nobody knows how to clear silently becomes a queue nobody clears, and the team's response is
to turn the zone off.

Three facts do most of the work. **`moose-docevals review` with no arguments lists what is waiting** —
readers assume they need to hunt through a report, and they do not. **A recorded verdict persists**, so
this is not a per-run tax; unchanged pages stay resolved. And **verdicts self-invalidate when the page
changes**, which is the property that makes persistence safe rather than a way to accumulate stale
approvals. That last one must be stated explicitly, because a reader who does not know it will either
distrust persistence or over-trust it.

`--fail-on-review` is a genuine policy fork and the docs should present it as one rather than
recommending a default. Blocking on review means the queue is never ignored and pull requests
sometimes wait on a person; not blocking keeps the pipeline moving and lets the queue rot. Which is
right depends on whether the team has someone who owns the queue — and naming that as the deciding
question is more useful than a recommendation.

The last step is the important one and is easy to omit: **a repeat offender is a diagnosis, not a
chore.** An eval that lands in review every single run is telling you its assertion is ambiguous, and
the repair is in [`cuj-write-judgeable-assertions`](cuj-write-judgeable-assertions.md), not in
answering it faster forever.

Shared between [Sara](../personas/sara-standard-owner.md), who owns the standard and usually the
queue, and [Priya](../personas/priya-corpus-owner.md), who owns whether the queue is anyone's job.
Note that [Theo](../personas/theo-contributor.md) *encounters* this zone in
[`cuj-fix-red-check`](cuj-fix-red-check.md) and cannot resolve it — being told to escalate, and to
whom, is his correct outcome.

**Status.** All 7 steps are served by written pages (5 distinct). Re-check this when the journey changes: a step whose `doc` no longer resolves, or a new step with no page behind it, is the signal that this journey has drifted ahead of the docs.
