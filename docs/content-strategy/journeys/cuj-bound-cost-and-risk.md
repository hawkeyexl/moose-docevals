# CUJ: Bound what the gate can spend and what it can execute

**Scope:** the two ways an eval gate can hurt you that an ordinary docs linter cannot. Those are
**arbitrary code execution driven by content files**, and **metered spend in the critical path**. Installing and
operating the gate is [`cuj-ci-wire`](cuj-ci-wire.md); this journey is what keeps that installation
from becoming an incident.

**Trigger.** The gate works and is now exposed to pull requests from outside the organization. Or a
finance question arrived about a line item nobody predicted.

**Narrative.** This is the **highest-stakes journey on the site**. It is the only one where a
plausible-sounding wrong answer causes real harm rather than a bad experience. It is
[Devin's](../personas/devin-pipeline-owner.md) alone. No other persona is equipped to reason about it,
and no other persona should be relied on to.

There are **two distinct paths from a content file to code running on a runner**, and conflating them
is the trap:

1. **Page frontmatter can declare commands.** `scripts.allow-frontmatter-commands` in config and
   `--no-frontmatter-commands` on the CLI gate this path. This is the one everybody finds.
2. **The `tool:doc-detective` grader executes steps embedded in page bodies.** The flag above does
   **not** gate this path.

A reader who sets `--no-frontmatter-commands` and concludes they are safe against a hostile fork is
wrong, and confidently so. The complete answer is that **the job itself must be gated to same-repo
pull requests**. Forks run a separate `--deterministic-only` job that has no credential and
no doc-detective grader. Any page that presents the flag as sufficient is worse than no page, because
it converts an unknown risk into a false sense of safety. This repo's own `verify-docs` job is built
exactly this way and is the worked example.

The cost half is less dangerous and more likely to end an adoption. Model calls are metered per
invocation, so the failure is not one large bill but an unpredictable one. Unpredictable is what
gets a check removed. Two facts do the work. `judge.max-turns` and `fill.max-turns` bound how many
*uncached* inference calls a run may make. Caching is content-addressed, so an unchanged page and
an unchanged assertion never re-judge. A cache hit is not a turn, so a fully cached run completes
under any budget. That is what makes the steady-state work of a docs PR approximately zero. Devin
needs that number, and it is the one least obvious from the outside.

**The unit is calls, not money, and pages must not quietly convert between them.** One judged eval
spends `judge.ensemble-runs` turns (three by default); one page filled by `fill` spends one. That is
countable from the corpus *before* the run. The cap can therefore be claimed up front rather than
tallied afterwards, and so holds exactly under concurrency. The tool reports no dollar figure at all.
The price table behind the ceiling this replaced was never this repo's. It reported nothing for
`claude-cli` or a self-hosted endpoint (ADR 01019). A page that hands Devin a cost estimate is
inventing it. What it owes him is the call count and his provider's own rate card.

**Exhausting the budget does not fail the run.** Targets past the cap are marked *skipped*, and
skipped evals are excluded from the suite pass rate. A run that hits its ceiling exits `0` with
less coverage than the reader believes they bought. Any page presenting `--max-turns` as a safety net
owes the reader that sentence. A silently degraded green run is a worse operational failure
than a red one.

**Status.** All 7 steps are served by written pages (3 distinct). Re-check this when the journey changes. A step whose `doc` no longer resolves signals that this journey has drifted ahead of the docs. So does a new step with no page behind it.
