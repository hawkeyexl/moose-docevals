# Critical user journeys

**Scope:** the twelve end-to-end outcomes the docs must support, and which persona takes each. The
people are in [`../personas/`](../personas/_overview.md); where each journey's steps land in the site
is [`../information-architecture/proposed-ia.md`](../information-architecture/proposed-ia.md).

A CUJ is a complete outcome someone reaches **using moose-docevals**, not a topic. Each one lists ordered
steps, and every step names a real repo-relative doc path with an `exists:` marker. That is what
turns this directory into a checkable backlog rather than a wish list.

Every persona has at least one primary journey and every journey has at least one persona. The
distribution is uneven by design. Sara owns four primaries. Assertion craft, calibration, the
review queue, and the push toward cheaper graders are four distinct jobs that happen to sit with one
role. Theo owns exactly one, because his entire relationship with the tool is a single page.

## The backbone

[`cuj-first-gate`](cuj-first-gate.md) is the backbone: install → assert → run → gate. It is the
only journey that crosses every layer: the frontmatter contract, the grader hierarchy, the judge, the
output format, and CI. Everything below either specializes one of its steps or picks up where it ends:

- **Authoring** grows out of the "write an assertion" step
  - [`cuj-write-judgeable-assertions`](cuj-write-judgeable-assertions.md), the wording of one eval
    - [`cuj-trust-the-judge`](cuj-trust-the-judge.md), proving the wording holds at scale
      - [`cuj-resolve-review`](cuj-resolve-review.md), the recurring queue that follows
  - [`cuj-eval-library`](cuj-eval-library.md), many assertions, shared
  - [`cuj-orchestrate-tools`](cuj-orchestrate-tools.md), the deterministic half of the hierarchy
- **Scale** grows out of "do this for more than one page"
  - [`cuj-bootstrap-corpus`](cuj-bootstrap-corpus.md), propose instead of hand-write
    - [`cuj-retrofit-corpus`](cuj-retrofit-corpus.md), the same, when day one would be all red
- **Operations** grows out of the "land the CI step" step
  - [`cuj-ci-wire`](cuj-ci-wire.md), install and operate
    - [`cuj-bound-cost-and-risk`](cuj-bound-cost-and-risk.md), keep it from becoming an incident
- **Convergent**, reached from authoring *and* from scale
  - [`cuj-cheapen-evals`](cuj-cheapen-evals.md), push evals down the grader hierarchy
- **Standalone**
  - [`cuj-fix-red-check`](cuj-fix-red-check.md), reached from a CI annotation, never from another
    journey

When two journeys disagree about how something should be explained, the backbone wins.

## Reading the steps

Each step is `{ stage, doc, exists, note }`, where `doc` is a **repo-relative source path** so
`exists` can be checked with a file test:

| `exists` | Meaning | Count today |
|---|---|---|
| `true` | A real page serves this step | **82**, all of them |
| `partial` | A file exists at that path but does not serve the step | 0 |
| `false` | The page does not exist and the journey needs it | 0 |

The content set is written, so this table has changed job. It was a backlog; it is now a **drift
detector**. Two failures it catches:

- A step whose `doc` no longer resolves, meaning a page was renamed or removed without updating the journey.
- A step added to a journey with no page behind it, meaning the strategy has run ahead of the docs.

Both are caught by a file test over `steps[].doc`, which is why the field holds a repo-relative source
path rather than a published URL.

## Concentration, and what it tells us

Four pages carry a disproportionate share of the steps, which is a useful signal about where the
writing effort actually is:

| Page | Steps | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `ci/untrusted-pull-requests.mdx` | 4 | The highest-consequence page on the site, where a plausible wrong answer causes real harm |
| `fix/index.mdx` | 4 | Correct, because the whole journey should be one page, not a section |
| `evals/write-good-assertions.mdx` | 3 | The page that does most for Sara |
| `judge/index.mdx` | 3 | Three separate journeys need the judging model explained |
